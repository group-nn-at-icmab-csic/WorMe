   abstract = {Fiji is a distribution of the popular open-source software ImageJ focused on biological-image analysis. Fiji uses modern software engineering practices to combine powerful software libraries with a broad range of scripting languages to enable rapid prototyping of image-processing algorithms. Fiji facilitates the transformation of new algorithms into ImageJ plugins that can be shared with end users through an integrated update system. We propose Fiji as a platform for productive collaboration between computer science and biology research communities. © 2012 Nature America, Inc. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {The roundworm Caenorhabditis elegans is an effective model system for biological processes such as immunity, behavior, and metabolism. Robotic sample preparation together with automated microscopy and image analysis has recently enabled high-throughput screening experiments using C. elegans. So far, such experiments have been limited to per-image measurements due to the tendency of the worms to cluster, which prevents extracting features from individual animals. We present a novel approach for the extraction of individual C. elegans from clusters of worms in high-throughput microscopy images. The key ideas are the construction of a low-dimensional shape-descriptor space and the definition of a probability measure on it. Promising segmentation results are shown. ©2010 IEEE.},
