ERMES is the C++ implementation of a simplified version of the weighted regularized Maxwell equation method. This finite element formulation has the advantage of producing well-conditioned matrices and the capacity of solving problems in the low (quasi-static) and high frequency regimens. As a consequence of this versatility, ERMES has been applied successfully to microwave engineering, antenna design, electromagnetic compatibility and eddy currents problems. This paper describes the main features of ERMES and explains how to use this numerical tool for computing electromagnetic fields in frequency domain. © 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Adaptive thresholding is a form of thresholding that takes into account spatial variations in illumination. We present a technique for real-time adaptive thresholding using the integral image of the input. Our technique is an extension of a previous method. However, our solution is more robust to illumination changes in the image. Additionally, our method is simple and easy to implement. Our technique is suitable for processing live video streams at a real-time frame-rate, making it a valuable tool for interactive applications such as augmented reality.

Specifically, we address the problem of untangling Caenorhabditis elegans clusters in high-throughput screening experiments. We represent the skeleton of each worm cluster by a sparse directed graph whose vertices and edges correspond to worm segments and their adjacencies, respectively. We then search for paths in the graph that are most likely to represent worms while minimizing overlap. The worm likelihood measure is defined on a low-dimensional feature space that captures different worm poses, obtained from a training set of isolated worms.

   abstract = {This work is motivated by the mostly unsolved task of parsing biological images with multiple overlapping articulated model organisms (such as worms or larvae). We present a general approach that separates the two main challenges associated with such data, individual object shape estimation and object groups disentangling. At the core of the approach is a deep feed-forward singling-out network (SON) that is trained to map each local patch to a vectorial descriptor that is sensitive to the characteristics (e.g. shape) of a central object, while being invariant to the variability of all other surrounding elements. Given a SON, a local image patch can be matched to a gallery of isolated elements using their SON-descriptors, thus producing a hypothesis about the shape of the central element in that patch. The image-level optimization based on integer programming can then pick a subset of the hypotheses to explain (parse) the whole image and disentangle groups of organisms. While sharing many similarities with existing "analysisby- synthesis" approaches, our method avoids the need for stochastic search in the high-dimensional configuration space and numerous rendering operations at test-time. We show that our approach can parse microscopy images of three popular model organisms (the C.Elegans roundworms, the Drosophila larvae, and the E. Coli bacteria) even under significant crowding and overlaps between organisms. We speculate that the overall approach is applicable to a wider class of image parsing problems concerned with crowded articulated objects, for which rendering training images is possible.},

We annotate nematodes with curved lines along the body, which is more suitable for worm-shaped objects than bounding boxes. The trained model predicts worm skeletons and body endpoints. The endpoints serve to untangle the skeletons from which segmentation masks are reconstructed by estimating the body width at each location along the skeleton. With light-weight backbone networks, we achieve 75.85% precision, 73.02% recall on a potato cyst nematode data set and 84.20% precision, 85.63% recall on a public C. elegans data set.},

   abstract = {Background. Dietary restriction (DR) results in increased longevity, reduced fecundity and reduced growth in many organisms. Though many studies have examined the effects of DR on longevity and fecundity, few have investigated the effects on growth. Results. Here we use Caenorhabditis elegans to determine the mechanisms that regulate growth under DR. We show that rather than a reduction in cell number, decreased growth in wild type C. elegans under DR is correlated with lower levels of hypodermal polyploidization. We also show that mutants lacking wild type sensory ciliated neurons are small, exhibit hypo-polyploidization and more importantly, when grown under DR, reduce their levels of endoreduplication to a lesser extent than wild type, suggesting that these neurons are required for the regulation of hypodermal polyploidization in response to DR. Similarly, we also show that the cGMP-dependent protein kinase EGL-4 and the SMA/MAB signalling pathway regulate polyploidization under DR. Conclusion. We show C. elegans is capable of actively responding to food levels to regulate adult ploidy. We suggest this response is dependent on the SMA/MAB signalling pathway. © 2008 Tain et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

C. elegans worms are usually grown on an E. coli strain OP50. We show that the wild-type worms fed on another E. coli strain HB101 grow 1.6 times as large as those fed on OP50. The regression line representing the relationship between the sizes of worms grown on each food for over 30 mutants was drawn, indicating that small mutants tend to be more affected by the change in food. Mutants for the DAF-2 insulin/IGF-1 receptor and downstream SGK-1, a homolog of the serum- and glucocorticoid-inducible kinase, grow less or little larger on HB101, indicating control of body size by these factors. Results on the suppression of mutations in these factors by a mutation in the DAF-16/FOXO transcription factor indicate both DAF-16-dependent and DAF-16-independent control. Furthermore, we show that the food-dependent body size change is because of a change in cell size that is closely related to the protein content per cell. © 2011 The Authors.

However, their toxic effects, especially on the nervous system, have not yet been extensively investigated, and most of the knowledge is based on studies using different conditions and systems, thus hard to compare. In this work, physicochemical properties of non-modified polystyrene (PS) and amine-functionalized PS (PS-NH2) nanoparticles are initially characterized. Advantage of a multisystemic approach is then taken to compare plastic nanoparticles effects in vitro, through cytotoxic readouts in mammalian cell culture, and in vivo, through behavioral readouts in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans), a powerful 3R-complying model organism for toxicology studies. In vitro experiments in neuroblastoma cells indicate a specific cytotoxic effect of PS-NH2 particles, including a decreased neuronal differentiation and an increased Amyloid β (Aβ) secretion, a sensitive readout correlating with Alzheimer's disease pathology. In parallel, only in vivo treatments with PS-NH2 particles affect C. elegans development, decrease lifespan, and reveal higher sensitivity of animals expressing human Aβ compared to wild-type animals. In summary, the multisystemic approach discloses a neurotoxic effect induced by aminated polystyrene nanoparticles.},

   abstract = {Experimental studies and clinical trials of nanoparticles for treating diseases are increasing continuously. However, the reach to the market does not correlate with these efforts due to the enormous cost, several years of development, and off-target effects like cardiotoxicity. Multicellular organisms such as the Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) can bridge the gap between in vitro and vertebrate testing as they can provide extensive information on systemic toxicity and specific harmful effects through facile experimentation following 3R EU directives on animal use. Since the nematodes’ pharynx shares similarities with the human heart, we assessed the general and pharyngeal effects of drugs and polypyrrole nanoparticles (Ppy NPs) using C. elegans. The evaluation of FDA-approved drugs, such as Propranolol and Racepinephrine reproduced the arrhythmic behavior reported in humans and supported the use of this small animal model. Consequently, Ppy NPs were evaluated due to their research interest in cardiac arrhythmia treatments. The NPs’ biocompatibility was confirmed by assessing survival, growth and development, reproduction, and transgenerational toxicity in C. elegans. Interestingly, the NPs increased the pharyngeal pumping rate of C. elegans in two slow-pumping mutant strains, JD21 and DA464. Moreover, the NPs increased the pumping rate over time, which sustained up to a day post-excretion. By measuring pharyngeal calcium levels, we found that the impact of Ppy NPs on the pumping rate could be mediated through calcium signaling. Thus, evaluating arrhythmic effects in C. elegans offers a simple system to test drugs and nanoparticles, as elucidated through Ppy NPs.},

BNCf were uptaken and excreted by worms without crossing the intestinal barrier, confirming its biosafety regarding survival rate, reproduction, and aging for concentrations up to 34 μg/ml BNCf. However, a slight decrease in the worms' length was detected. A possible nutrient shortage or stress produced by BNCf was discarded by measuring stress and chemotactic response pathways. Besides, we detected a lipid-lowering effect of BNCf in N2 C. elegans in normal and high-caloric diets. Oxidative damage was computed in N2 worms and Rac1/ced-10 mutants. The GTPase Rac1 is involved in neurological diseases, where its dysregulation enhances ROS production and neuronal damage. BNCf reduced the lipid oxidative markers produced by ROS species in this worm strain. Finally, we detected that BNCf activated the genetic expression of the immunological response and lipid catabolic process. These results strengthen the use of BNCf as a functional dietary fiber and encourage the potential treatment of neurological disease by modulating diet.},

   abstract = {The fundamental phenotypes of growth rate, size and morphology are the result of complex interactions between genotype and environment. We developed a high-throughput software application, WormSizer, which computes size and shape of nematodes from brightfield images. Existing methods for estimating volume either coarsely model the nematode as a cylinder or assume the worm shape or opacity is invariant. Our estimate is more robust to changes in morphology or optical density as it only assumes radial symmetry. This open source software is written as a plugin for the well-known image-processing framework Fiji/ImageJ. It may therefore be extended easily. We evaluated the technical performance of this framework, and we used it to analyze growth and shape of several canonical Caenorhabditis elegans mutants in a developmental time series. We confirm quantitatively that a <underline>D</underline>um<underline>py</underline> (Dpy) mutant is short and fat and that a <underline>Lon</underline>g (Lon) mutant is long and thin. We show that daf-2 insulin-like receptor mutants are larger than wild-type upon hatching but grow slow, and WormSizer can distinguish dauer larvae from normal larvae. We also show that a <underline>Sma</underline>ll (Sma) mutant is actually smaller than wild-type at all stages of larval development. WormSizer works with <underline>Unc</underline>oordinated (Unc) and <underline>Rol</underline>ler (Rol) mutants as well, indicating that it can be used with mutants despite behavioral phenotypes. We used our complete data set to perform a power analysis, giving users a sense of how many images are needed to detect different effect sizes. Our analysis confirms and extends on existing phenotypic characterization of well-characterized mutants, demonstrating the utility and robustness of WormSizer. © 2013 Moore et al.},

   abstract = {Phenotypic assays are crucial in genetics; however, traditional methods that rely on human observation are unsuitable for quantitative, large-scale experiments. Furthermore, there is an increasing need for comprehensive analyses of multiple phenotypes to provide multidimensional information. Here we developed an automated, high-throughput computer imaging system for quantifying multiple Caenorhabditis elegans phenotypes. Our imaging system is composed of a microscope equipped with a digital camera and a motorized stage connected to a computer running the QuantWorm software package. Currently, the software package contains one data acquisition module and four image analysis programs: WormLifespan, WormLocomotion, WormLength, and WormEgg. The data acquisition module collects images and videos. The WormLifespan software counts the number of moving worms by using two time-lapse images; the WormLocomotion software computes the velocity of moving worms; the WormLength software measures worm body size; and the WormEgg software counts the number of eggs. To evaluate the performance of our software, we compared the results of our software with manual measurements. We then demonstrated the application of the QuantWorm software in a drug assay and a genetic assay. Overall, the QuantWorm software provided accurate measurements at a high speed. Software source code, executable programs, and sample images are available at www.quantworm.org. Our software package has several advantages over current imaging systems for C. elegans. It is an all-in-one package for quantifying multiple phenotypes. The QuantWorm software is written in Java and its source code is freely available, so it does not require use of commercial software or libraries. It can be run on multiple platforms and easily customized to cope with new methods and requirements. © 2014 Jung et al.},

   abstract = {Accurately measuring the length of an animal's body is essential to studying the effects of various chemicals, genes, and the environment on the animal's growth. AniLength was developed to measure the body length of small worms present in images using hybrid image processing and deep neural network (DNN)-based image classification. The software not only includes a pretrained DNN model learned from approximately 16,000 images using ResNet-V2-101 for Caenorhabditis elegans analysis, but it can also perform new training using custom training images. AniLength is a user-friendly GUI-based software that runs on Microsoft Windows.},
