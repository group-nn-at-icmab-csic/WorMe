## Software description, use and features

*(Brief description of the program)*

WorMe has been developed in MATLAB 2024b version, because of the improvements of the updated version, but it can be used as well in MATLAB 2021b. The installation and use of the program doesn’t need the license, and it is done by an executable file.

Manually select provide a high reliable and quality data.

The objective of WorMe is to provide the automated obtaining of the length of C.elegans from images by directly visualization, in analogy to the manual measurement, ensuring on the same way reliability and origin of the data.

The program works in a lineal set of pannels. There is a first image processment settings, where the user sets the image processing settings. Following it, there is the selection pannel, where the user visualizes the C. elegans measurements and selects manually the correct ones. Finally there is a pannel of data results and image object export. 

The manual measurement selection may be time-consuming step, but it guarantees a quality and reliable data (see Results and Discussion). 

User-based design

The design of the program is based on the user necessities, ensuring being intuitive in the installation and use of the program tools, without the necessity to the user to know about code languages.

The program’s computational operation has been optimized in order to rely a good timing in the processment and analysis of the image and objecs, and in the time of using by the user.
