## Software description, use and features

*(Brief description of the program)*

ðŸ”µ 6. **WorMe briefly description and comparison**: description of the WorMe characteristics and comparison to the other software.  
â€ƒðŸ”µ a. **Ad hoc image typology and requirements**: each software used to respond to specific requirements (*Ad hoc*), as well as their images. â†’ We too ad hoc (microscopical images), but versatility in the original image properties and objects characteristics because the further image processing  
â€ƒâ€ƒðŸ”µ i. Many image-processing tools (Image processing and Computer Vision MATLAB)  
â€ƒâ€ƒðŸ”µ ii. Exportation of the image processing  

â€ƒðŸ”µ b. **User-oriented, user-friendly, easy and intuitive**: The main program has not a code level, but the software is easy GUI user-oriented and intuitive. Installation complications. No code.  
â€ƒâ€ƒðŸ”µ i. Easy to install  
â€ƒâ€ƒâ€ƒ1. Open described functions  
â€ƒâ€ƒðŸ”µ ii. Easy to use: panels and easy tutorials.  
â€ƒâ€ƒðŸ”µ iii. Easy import and export of the images and data  

â€ƒðŸ”µ c. **Data quality**: direct visualizations and selection of the measurements.  
â€ƒâ€ƒðŸ”µ i. No false-positives  

â€ƒðŸ”µ d. **Semi-automated**, but reaches to solve time and obtain curated results  

â€ƒðŸ”µ e. **Free of software requirements**: free, open, no need to install other software.  
â€ƒâ€ƒðŸ”µ i. Open functions of the code  

â€ƒðŸ”µ f. **Computationally optimized**: Program functions are optimized and users donâ€™t have to wait for the loading of the processes.  

â€ƒðŸ”µ g. **Artificial Intelligence landscape** (brush)  
â€ƒâ€ƒðŸ”µ i. Possibility to export the generated graphical data, for main models.  
â€ƒâ€ƒðŸ”µ ii. Is not IA integrated, despite is the state-of-art, but it pretend to be useful at same time to led the basis for future model creation. *(repository of images? in software description part)*  
â€ƒâ€ƒðŸ”µ iii. Working for future integration of C. elegans identification and segmentation Deep Learning models, to automatize and improve the process.



WorMe has been developed in MATLAB 2024b version, because of the improvements of the updated version, but it can be used as well in MATLAB 2021b. The installation and use of the program doesnâ€™t need the license, and it is done by an executable file.

Manually select provide a high reliable and quality data.

The objective of WorMe is to provide the automated obtaining of the length of C.elegans from images by directly visualization, in analogy to the manual measurement, ensuring on the same way reliability and origin of the data.

The program works in a lineal set of pannels. There is a first image processment settings, where the user sets the image processing settings. Following it, there is the selection pannel, where the user visualizes the C. elegans measurements and selects manually the correct ones. Finally there is a pannel of data results and image object export. 

The manual measurement selection may be time-consuming step, but it guarantees a quality and reliable data (see Results and Discussion). 

User-based design

The design of the program is based on the user necessities, ensuring being intuitive in the installation and use of the program tools, without the necessity to the user to know about code languages.

The programâ€™s computational operation has been optimized in order to rely a good timing in the processment and analysis of the image and objecs, and in the time of using by the user.
